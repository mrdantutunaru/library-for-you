## Library Management System

An automated system to manage a public library. Everything is devided in modules like [api, web, domain]. Also there is a client side that uses server for different operations and to add them to mongodb. Here you can find all the features used in this project:
- Spring Boot 2.0
- Spring Security
- Swagger 2
- Lombok/Slf4j
- JSON
- Encoding/Decoding (JWS)
- Hibernate
- Postgresql
- Mongo DB
- JPA
- DTO
- Liquibase
- Thyemeleaf
- HTML
- Open Feign Client
- Certificates

Run the LibraryProjectApp from web module for starting the server.
For client side run LibraryclientApplication . Don't forget to change ports, db credentials etc. Hope you enjoy, you can pm me on my skype: van_dannu.
